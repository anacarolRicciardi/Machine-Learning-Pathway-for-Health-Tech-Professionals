# Family History of Rare Disease Dataset

This dataset contains synthetic data for studying the family history and risk factors associated with a rare genetic disease.

## Dataset Description

| Column Name                     | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Patient ID | Unique identifier for each patient. |
| Age | Age of the patient in years. |
| Gender | Gender of the patient (Male, Female, or Other). |
| Parental History | Whether a parent has a history of the disease (Yes/No). |
| Sibling History | Whether a sibling has a history of the disease (Yes/No). |
| Number of Relatives with Disease | Count of relatives diagnosed with the rare disease. |
| Known Genetic Mutation | Whether the patient has a known genetic mutation associated with the disease (Yes/No). |
| Early Onset Cases in Family | Whether there are cases of early onset in the family (Yes/No). |
| Environmental Risk Exposure | The level of environmental risk exposure (High, Moderate, or Low). |
| geneticTest | The result of the genetic test for the disease (P for Positive, N for Negative). |

## Usage
This dataset can be used to predict the results of genetic testing based on family history and environmental risk factors. It is suitable for binary classification tasks.
